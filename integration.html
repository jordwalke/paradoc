This page tells you how to:

- Use a single `.html` as both a Github markdown preview and your website.
- Highlight as markdown in Vim/Emacs.
- Work well with Safari in development mode.

If none of that is interesting to you then this page is not for you. You just
keep writing `.html` markdown files with a single script tag at the top, and
(optional) YAML headers:

```markdown
<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>
---
title: You don't even need to include this --- YAML header
---
Nothing fancy  for you!
- Just regular markdown files
- With a single <script></script> tag at the top.
```

For the rest of you, read on.



### All The Integrations

The rest of this page explains each of the Github/editor/browser integration
options in detail. Here's a quick example of using all the integrations at once
at the start of an html markdown file. This example:

- Tells Github to render a markdown preview of your page in your repo and tells
  Vim to highlight it as markdown.
- Include a style that hides the flash of content when loading the page in
  local development mode.
- Makes Safari play nicer with UTF-8 text in development mode.
- Includes the `Paradoc.js` script.

```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<style type="text/css">body {visibility: hidden} </style>)
[//]: # (<meta charset="utf-8">)
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
---
title: My Page Title
rootPage: readme
---
```


#### Hiding The YAML headers in Github preview

To take it a step further, you can hide the YAML headers in Github's preview
rendering, while still providing that header information to Paradoc for
configuring your page.  Just include the YAML yeader lines in comments as well.
The previous example becomes:

```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<style type="text/css">body {visibility: hidden} </style>)
[//]: # (<meta charset="utf-8">)
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
[//]: # (---)
[//]: # (title: My Page Title)
[//]: # (rootPage: bookmark)
[//]: # (---)
```



### Background

Github by default will not render a `README.html` (or any `.html` file) as
markdown, unless it knows it's a markdown file.
Similarly, vim/emacs will not highlight an html file as markdown unless you
instruct it to.

The way that you instruct Github and Vim to treat the html file as a markdown
file is the same. You must include the text `vim: set filetype=Markdown:`
somewhere in the first line. You _could_ stick the text `vim: set
filetype=Markdown:` at the top of your file, and it would work but Github would
_also_ render that literal text which is not what you want.

### Comments To The Rescue

Markdown supports comments of the following form:

```markdown
[//]: # (you can put anything you want here)
```

<continueRight/>

The text between the `( )` will not be rendered by Github's preview, and
Paradoc will also ignore then when rendering the page.

#### Make Github Render Markdown Preview

While it won't be rendered, fortunately Vim/Github will still search for
`vim: set filetype=Markdown:` inside the parenthesis, so we can include a
markdown comment at the top of the document that tells Github/editors to treat
this file as markdown even though it has an html extension.

```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
```


#### Hide The Script Tag In Github Preview

Github will also render the initial `<script>` include at the top of files as
plain text which is not what you want. You wanted to use a single `.html`
source of truth as your main Paradoc page, and have it render nicely on
Github!  We can use the same markdown comment trick that we used with the vim
filetype line to hide the script tag in Github's preview. Let's add this to
the previous example:

```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
Your regular markdown _here_.
```


Now Github will render your Paradoc `.html` page as a markdown preview in your
repo. Pretty cool! There's one small problem. When in development mode (locally
authoring/reloading) there _might_ be a small flash of unstyled text when
reloading depending on how fast you reload (the contents up until the script
tag).
We can fix that by including a page hider in yet another markdown comment
(inserted before the script include).
```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<style type="text/css">body {visibility: hidden} </style>)
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
Your regular markdown _here_.
```

So now we have a single source of truth `.html` page that can function as both
a Paradoc website, and render nicely in your Github repo's markdown preview,
and it feels great when reloading it locally in development mode.

#### Hide The YAML header In Github Preview


```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<style type="text/css">body {visibility: hidden} </style>)
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
Your regular markdown _here_.
```

#### Silent Github YAML Headers

If you are using a single source of truth for both Github markdown preview and
your Paradoc website, you might want to hide the YAML headers in the Github
preview (Github renders them as a nice looking table, but maybe you want to
omit them entirely).

Paradoc provides a solution using - you guessed it - markdown comments!
Paradoc supports embedding ("silent") YAML headersl in markdown comments.
This is a bookmark specific feature. Github and all other markdown tooling will
ignore these headers, but Paradoc will still pay attention to them to
configure your page. We'll continue building from the previous example, and
addd silent YAML headers.


```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<style type="text/css">body {visibility: hidden} </style>)
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
[//]: # (---)
[//]: # (title: My Page Title)
[//]: # (rootPage: readme)
[//]: # (---)
Your regular markdown _here_.
```


This prevents the header metadata from being rendered as a table in Github's viewer,
but Paradoc will still extract them just as if they were YAML headers.
The result is a single Paradoc doc that serves as a Github viewable markdown page,
as well as powering a website.

#### Developing In Safari:

Safari does not interpret the encoding of files as utf-8 by default unless the
html document has `<meta charset="utf-8">` at the top of the file.  That means
any `.html` page, or style `.html` page must have `<meta charset="utf-8">` at
the top, if you want to be able to load it in Safari.  This only effects
development mode because normally you would perform a build of the site before
deploying it, where the encoding issue doesn't arise.

Putting everything together gives us the following file:

```markdown
[//]: # ( vim: set filetype=Markdown: )
[//]: # (<style type="text/css">body {visibility: hidden} </style>)
[//]: # (<meta charset="utf-8">)
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
[//]: # (---)
[//]: # (title: My Page Title)
[//]: # (rootPage: readme)
[//]: # (---)
Your regular markdown _here_.
```

## More Options:

#### Emacs File Detection

Instead of using the Vim file detection line to trick Github into rendering yor
preview, you could use the following line using the emacs file detection form.
This is the same as the Vim form except it will tell Emacs to highlight as Markdown
instead of telling Vim to do so.

```markdown
[//]: # (-*-mode:markdown-*-)
```



### How Paradoc Works

`README.md.html` is both a valid html page and a valid markdown page. Because
browsers allow loading of html pages in iframes across origins, no web server
is needed to develop and reload docs entirely in the browser without a build
step/web server.

`README.md.html` looks like:

```markdown
<script src="site/Paradoc.js"></script>
Everything _after_ the first line is
plain **markdown**.
1. Nothing needs to be escaped.
2. Not even if your markdown contains
  a `<script>` tag.
```
<continueRight/>

Everything after the first line is plain markdown. There is nothing special you
need to do to your markdown even though it is in an `.html` file. You can
include literally any markdown after that first script tag line, and you don't
have to escape any of it. The browser won't even think you're starting a script
region if you include a `<script>` tag somewhere after the first line. How?
The inclusion of the first `Paradoc.js` script forces the rest of the document
to be interpreted as plain text that needn't be escaped.

When you have your script include be specified in a markdown comment like this:


```markdown
[//]: # (<script src="site/Paradoc.js"> </script>)
Everything _after_ the first line is
plain **markdown**.
- Even this `<script>` text.
```

<continueRight/>

Then the browser will still run the script tag as usual, and Paradoc will
delete all the text content that was included before the first line's
'`<script`.  The fact that the script include is inside of a markdown comment
tells Github rendering to not show the `<script>` tag.



#### `.gitattributes` Approach:
There is an approach to getting Github to render your `.html` page as markdown
that uses `.gitattributes`.  This is left as an exercise to the reader.
